# mnist-web

Full implementation of the MNIST model + pretrained network, all running within the browser

# Notes

The canvas is a little janky, so it might give the model incorrect pixel values and then the model predicts really badly

# How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/duccdev/mnist-web.git
cd mnist-web
npm i
npm run dev
```

And then visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser
